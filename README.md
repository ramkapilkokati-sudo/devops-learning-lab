# 🚀 DevOps Learning Lab

This repository contains my 37-day journey to mastering **Linux**, **AWS**, **Ansible**, and **Terraform** — focusing on cloud automation and real-world infrastructure projects.

## 🧠 Structure
- `linux/` → Linux administration, troubleshooting & automation
- `ansible/` → Playbooks, roles, and configuration management
- `aws/` → Cloud concepts, networking, and services
- `terraform/` → IaC automation of AWS resources

## ⚙️ CI/CD
This repo uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically validate:
- Terraform syntax (`terraform validate`)
- Ansible playbook syntax (`ansible-playbook --syntax-check`)

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong hands-on foundation for a **Linux/Cloud Engineer role** using real projects.
